- 👋 Hi, I’m @Concave-World
- 👀 I’m interested in building a central repository for the Concave community to be able to build and innovate the Concave World space on Gather-Town. We strive to leverage gather town as a social hub for the community of the DeFi project Concave (http://concave.lol/)
- ❓ This repository is a fork of gathertown/mapmaking repository (https://github.com/gathertown/mapmaking) and updates are fetched from upstream weekly.
- 🍯 Gather is centered around fully customizable spaces, Gather makes spending time with your communities just as easy as real life.

Want to contribute?

Due to the nature of mapmaking and permissions on gather-town, we ask all contributors setup GitHub Desktop and Tiled mapmaker and make pull requests from their own branch for approval. This setup will allow you to create maps using 32x32 square blocks and gather-town tilsets while allowing contributors to submit pull requests that include foreground, background, and asset images. These images once approved and merged to the master Concave-World repo will be implemented to the Concave World gather space.

*Take note Concave-World has specific guidelines for mapmaking
